# Ultimate TTT Web Client

This is the web client for Ultimate Tic Tac Toe Algorithm Battles :1:

It can connect to a running server and display info about the games being played, the users online...

You can also upload game logs and visualize the games move by move to debug your strategy.

## Getting started

A version of this client is always running at [play.socialgorithm.org](https://play.socialgorithm.org)

If you want to deploy your own version clone this repository and run `npm start`.

## Dev stuff

This client is built with React, and some other modern libraries. It was bootstrapped from [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) so you may already be familiar with the structure.

We use [Semantic UI](http://semantic-ui.com/) for the UI/UX.
